Sternberg Memory Task
Introduction
The Sternberg Memory Task is a psychological experiment used to study short-term memory. Participants are presented with a series of numbers, asked to remember them, and then tested on their ability to recall whether a single number was in the initial series.

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Sadra1381am/Strenberg.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Sternberg
Install the required dependencies: pip install pygame
Usage
Run the main script: python sternberg.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the memory task.
How It Works
Participants are presented with a series of numbers for a few seconds.
The numbers are then removed, and a single number (probe) is presented.
Participants must indicate whether the probe was in the initial series.
Their responses and response times are recorded for analysis.
