# Sternberg Memory Task

## Introduction
The Sternberg Memory Task is a psychological experiment used to study short-term memory. Participants are presented with a series of numbers, asked to remember them, and then tested on their ability to recall whether a single number was in the initial series.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Sadra1381am/Strenberg.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Sternberg`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pygame`

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python sternberg.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the memory task.

## How It Works
1. Participants are presented with a series of numbers for a few seconds.
2. The numbers are then removed, and a single number (probe) is presented.
3. Participants must indicate whether the probe was in the initial series.
4. Their responses and response times are recorded for analysis.
